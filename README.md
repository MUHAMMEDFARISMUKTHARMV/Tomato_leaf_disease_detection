Detecting tomato leaves disease
This study uses YOLOv8, an enhanced version of the YOLO object detection model, to provide a unique method for predicting tomato leaf disease. The model is trained on a large dataset that includes photos of both healthy and diseased tomato leaves, including those with Early Blight, Late Blight, Leaf Miner, Leaf Mould, Mosaic Virus, Septoria, Spider Mites, and Yellow Leaf Curl Virus. By utilising deep learning techniques, the suggested method correctly categorises the leaves of tomato plants as either healthy or unhealthy, and if a disease is present, it also pinpoints the exact ailment. The algorithm achieves great accuracy in disease diagnosis and real-time prediction capabilities by examining the unique visual characteristics linked to each disease. This makes it easier to implement management plans and timely interventions, giving farmers the ability to minimise the spread of disease and maximise crop health and output. The suggested strategy is a major development in agricultural technology and provides a workable way to increase crop productivity and food security in a sustainable manner.
